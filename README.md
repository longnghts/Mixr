# Mixr

Mixr is a React web app for mixology. Simply search an ingredient and presto! you will see all of the drinks with that ingredient.
## Installation

Use npm i in the project root to install the required packages and the node_modules folder.

```bash
npm i
```

## About
This is mainly a project made in my free time and as something to put on my resume, but as more and more people are getting into making quality drinks at home, and entertaining as covid resrictions come to an end; I feel that it would be something that I will continue to work on going into the future.

If you would like to contribute, or get on board with this project, feel free to send me a message on discord! (you can find my details on my profile overview page!)
